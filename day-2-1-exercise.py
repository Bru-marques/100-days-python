# Instructions

# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

# **Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

####################################
# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
num = two_digit_number
num1 = int(num[0])
num2 = int(num[1])
print(num1 + num2)
